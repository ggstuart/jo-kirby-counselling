					<h2>
						Hello and welcome to my website
					</h2>

					<p>
						For all of us, at some time or other and for a wide spectrum of reasons life inevitably gets tough.
						It may be that you have experienced something that has deeply impacted you, or you may feel unsure about something, you may be struggling with anxiety or depression, or you might be feeling overwhelmed, stressed or stuck.
						You may have a particular problem or issue that you’d like to discuss with someone in confidence.
						Or, it may be behavior change that you’re seeking?
						Perhaps you’re having difficulty in your relationships?
						Or struggling to make sense of or come to terms with loss or issues that happened in the past.
						Maybe you just have a general sense that something isn’t quite right?
					</p>

			<p>
				Spending time, being listened to and heard and investing in yourself to work things out at a pace that you set and with no expectations may be exactly what you need in order to make sense of your feelings and to get the best out of your life and relationships.
			</p>

				“I am not what happened to me, I am what I choose to become.”

					<h2>Is counselling for me?</h2>
					<p>
						I understand that if you’re thinking about coming for counselling it can feel scary and the thought of opening up to a ‘stranger’ can potentially stir up a range of uncomfortable feelings.
						Counselling is a talking therapy and a process.
						You won’t be judged or criticized, you can develop a safe and trusting relationship to confidently explore your issues with someone who is objective, this is one of the reasons it can feel less complicated than talking to a friend or family member.
						Successful counselling can lead to greater understanding of yourself, greater self-acceptance, a stronger sense of identity, more resillience, improved relationships and increased purpose and meaning in life.
						It can also help with personal growth and development and reconnecting with your true authentic self.

				There is no set amount of sessions.
				Some people achieve what they want to in just a few short sessions, others find longer term and more in depth work more beneficial.

					<h2>
						About me & my approach
					</h2>

					<p>
						I understand that you are a unique individual and that no two people are the same and so I do not offer a ‘one size fits all’ approach. My core training is in psychodynamic therapy where we explore how your early life experiences may have shaped you and the way that you think about and relate to people. I am also qualified in Drug and Alcohol Counselling and Treatment to Post Graduate level and I have twenty years professional work experience in supporting roles, fifteen of which have been in a range of recovery services including NHS.
					</p>

					<p>
						I integrate some aspects of CBT, motivational interviewing, mindfulness and solution focused therapy into my work depending on what it is that you want to achieve by coming to therapy.
						I have worked as part of a multi-disciplinary team including psychiatrists and psychologists and I have experience of working with dual diagnosis ie mental health and substance use problems and also with complex trauma issues including childhood abuse and neglect.
					</p>

			<p>
				As well as my professional experience and training I am really easy to talk to, I‘m empathic understanding and most importantly I am a great listener.
